               fashion which results in the parser qualifying it to some local file:// path
               which breaks our detection here.
               So I have made a small mod to the stock XMLSchema.xsd so that it instead refers to
               resource:XMLSchema.dtd which can be looked up locally.
               The same is true for XMLSchema.dtd with regard to datatypes.dtd, so I have also
               modified XMLSchema.dtd to refer to resource:datatypes.dtd.
               An alternative would be to rely on publicId, however that would essentially hard code
               the lookup to always be in the classpath and rule out being able to redirect the location
               of the physical resource through the systemId, which is useful.
