/**
 * A configurer which starts up an alternate Spring file to configure some services that are needed in
 * "Thin Client" mode.  A "thin client" is a client which communicates directly with service
 * endpoints and doesn't use the registry or the message queue.  Esentially, all it uses the KSB for are
 * it's Digital Signature services.
 *
 * <p>TODO This is essentially a hack to allow for secure thin client mode of workflow to work properly
 * without requiring the entire service bus to be started (which requires datasources, etc.).  We need
 * to examine how better to support this sort of a concept in the future.
