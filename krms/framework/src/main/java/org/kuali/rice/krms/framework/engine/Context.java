 * The context represents the area(s) of an organization's activity where a

 * particular context and because they must be evaluated against the information in
 * that domain or context.

 * <p>For example, rules that are specifically authored and
 * that are meaningful in an application on a Research Proposal would be most
 * unlikely to make sense or be relevant in the context of a Student Record even
 * if the condition could be evaluated.
