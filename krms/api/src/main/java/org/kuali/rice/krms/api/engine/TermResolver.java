/**
 * <p>An {@link TermResolver} implementor is a utility class used for resolution (reification) of {@link Term}s.  There are a
 * few key concepts to understand how {@link TermResolver}s function and work together.
 * </p>
 * <ul>
 * <li><b>they can require prerequisite {@link Term}s (which must not have any parameters)</b>.  If they do, when the {@link TermResolutionEngine} calls 
 * {@link #resolve(Map, Map)} it will pass the resolved prerequisites in the first argument.
 * <li><b>they can be chained.</b>  This means that if the {@link TermResolutionEngine} has {@link TermResolver}s (a &lt;- b) and 
 * (b &lt;- c), and you have the fact 'c', you can ask for term 'a' and the engine will chain the resolvers together
 * to resolve it correctly.</li>
 * <li><b>they can be parameterized.</b> If an TermResolver takes parameters, they must be declared via the
 * {@link #getParameterNames()} method.  All declared parameters are considered to be required.  Parameters can be set
 * on the {@link Term} (via the constructor) that you are asking to resolve. When the {@link TermResolutionEngine} calls 
 * {@link #resolve(Map, Map)}, the parameters will be passed in to the second argument.</li>
 * <li><b>Parameterized {@link TermResolver}s can not be intermediates in a resolution plan.</b>  Another way to say 
 * this is that they can only be the last resolver in a chain.  For example, say
 * the {@link TermResolutionEngine} has {@link TermResolver}s (a &lt;- b) which takes no parameters, 
 * (b &lt;- c) which takes a parameter "foo", and you have the fact 'c'.  If you ask for Term 'a', the engine will not be able to resolve
 * it because it would need to use a parameterized Term as an intermediate step in resolution, and that isn't allowed.</li>
