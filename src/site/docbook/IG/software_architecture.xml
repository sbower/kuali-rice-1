        <title>Kuali Rice Implementations</title>
        <para>Kuali Rice is available for two types of implementations, Server (also known as
            client-server) and Bundled (packaged with Kuali applications).</para>
        <sect2>
            <title>Standalone Server </title>
            <para>The Server is the most versatile implementation of Rice. It is a web application
                that can provide services to multiple applications that integrate with Kuali Rice at
                your institution. The server distribution contains a web archive or WAR file for the
                Kuali Rice standalone server. The Server distribution is the one you should use when
                your enterprise wants to run multiple Kuali applications or when you want to
                integrate other applications with Rice. </para>
        </sect2>
        <sect2>
            <title>Bundled</title>
            <para>When an application bundles all of the Rice functionality (including what is
                usually handled by the standalone server) into the client application, it’s called a
                Bundled Distribution. For example, Kuali Financial Systems (KFS) has done this for
                their past releases. In those KFS releases, you did not need to set up and install a
                Rice standalone server; the necessary Rice functionality was bundled with
                KFS.</para>
            <para>Bundled Distributions are not recommended for enterprise implementations, but are
                good for quick start, testing, and demonstrations.</para>

        <sect2>
            <title>Source Code Distribution</title>
            <para>The Source Code Distribution is available if you want to build Rice from scratch
                and create the standalone or binary libraries yourself.</para>
        </sect2>
        <sect2>
            <title>Binary Distribution</title>
            <para>The Binary Distribution (also known as the client distribution) is a collection of
                JAR files. It is used when other applications need to use your Rice implementation
                and you won’t be using the Rice web application. It is designed for embedding Rice
                and can be used as a set of libraries for client applications.</para>
            <para>The Binary Distribution of Kuali Rice is implemented as an application framework
                consisting of application programming interfaces (APIs), libraries, and the web
                framework. This allows you to construct a Kuali Rice application. All JARs and web
                content are included in this version.</para>
        </sect2>
        <sect2>
            <title>Server Distribution</title>
            <para>This is the distribution that contains the standalone server WAR.</para>
        </sect2>
        <sect2>
            <title>Which Distribution to Use</title>
            <para>In a typical enterprise deployment of Kuali Rice, a Standalone Rice server hosts
                numerous shared services and provides the most versatility. The composition of Rice
                contains an application framework — the APIs, Libraries, and web framework that are
                used to construct a Rice application. You can configure subsequent Rice client
                applications to interact with these services as needed. </para>
