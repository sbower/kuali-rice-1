    <title>What is Kuali Rice?</title>
    <sect1>
        <title>Overview and Benefits of Kuali Rice</title>
        <para>Kuali Rice (also simply known as Rice) is an open source, module-based, enterprise
            class, set of integrated middleware products that allow both Kuali and non-Kuali
            applications to be built in an agile fashion so developers can create custom end-user
            business applications quickly and efficiently. Services are exposed through the Kuali
            Service Bus (KSB) and can be consumed by other Rice applications.</para>
        <para>Rice employs the Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) concept and is structured with
            both a server-side piece and a client-side piece. This framework allows end developers
            to build robust systems with common enterprise workflow functionality and with
            customizable and configurable user interfaces that have a clean and universal look and
            feel.</para>
        <para>On the server side, Kuali Rice is implemented as a group of services within a Servlet
            container. It can also run as a module within a web server such as Apache. Kuali Rice
            implements the Java Servlet specification from Sun Microsystems. This allows developers
            to design software that adds dynamic content to web servers using the Java programming
            language. Servlets are a server side technology that responds to web clients (typically
            web browsers) through a request/response paradigm. </para>
        <para>On the client side, Kuali Rice has a flexible framework of pieces that can be included
            in a Rice client application.</para>
        <para>The Rice Standalone Server is built on the client-server model and is provided as a
            web archive file (WAR). The Standalone version allows client applications to be
            configured to interface with the Rice server. </para>
        <para>The designers of Kuali Rice built it with a modular architecture where each module
            performs a specific function that offers services to applications. The Rice architecture
            has five major modules:<itemizedlist>

            </itemizedlist></para> 
        <note><para>The Kuali Nervous System is not administered from the Rice Standalone Server because
            it is a framework and not an application.</para></note>
        <para>Rice provides a reusable development framework that encourages a simplified approach
            to developing true business functionality in modular applications. </para>
        <para>Application and service developers can focus on solutions to solve business issues
            rather than on the technology. The Rice framework takes care of complex technical issues
            so that each application or service that adopts the framework can interoperate with
            little or no complexity. The framework also simplifies interoperation with services
            exposed by other applications.</para>
        <para>In addition, Rice supports the sophisticated workflow processes typically required in
            higher education. It addresses workflow processes that involve human interaction (i.e.,
            approval) as part of the flow. </para>

            <title>Operate Securely</title>
            <para>Rice has built-in security integration with support for data encryption, pluggable
                authentication, and pluggable authorization.</para>
