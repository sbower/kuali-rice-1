/**
 * Annotation for mimicing auto-incrementing fields.  Currently, only one auto-
 * incrementing field is allowed per entity, but could be modified in the future
 * if required (just add a @Sequences annotation that help an array of @Sequence
 * annotations). This is used in conjunction with the Kuali sequence managers rather
 * than the standard JPA generated value annotations. The reason is that Kuali 
 * uses a sequence like algorithm for all supported databases (mysql, oracle) 
 * rather than identity or auto-incrementing fields.
