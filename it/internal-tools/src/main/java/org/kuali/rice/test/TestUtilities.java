     * This method facilitates using annotations in a unit test class hierarchy.  We walk up the class hierarchy

     * defines one of the annotation types, it is marked for handling.  Once any single target annotation is found
     * on the class, it is marked and no further annotations are inspected.
     * 
     * If the annotation defines an 'overrideSuperClasses' method, and this method returns false, then processing
     * continues up the class hierarchy.  Otherwise processing stops when the first annotation is found.  Note that
     * this feature only makes sense when specifying a single annotation type.
     * 
     * After a list of classes in descending hierarchy order is compiled, the list is iterated over (again, in
     * descending hierarchy order) and if the class is not already present in the caller-supplied list of classes
     * already handled by the caller, the class is added to a list of classes that need to be handled by the caller,
     * which is then returned to the caller.
     * 
     * It is the caller's responsibility to handle the returned classes, and store them in some internal list which it may
     * give back to this method in the future.
