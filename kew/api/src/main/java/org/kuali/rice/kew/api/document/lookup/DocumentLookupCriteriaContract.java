/**
 * Defines the contract for criteria used to perform lookups of workflow document data.  None of the elements that can
 * be defined on the criteria are required.  Therefore, any method on this class may return a null value, though in the
 * case of collections, an empty collection will be returned instead.
 *
 * <p>In general, the different  values on the criteria allow the standard lookup "operators" as defined by
 * {@link org.kuali.rice.core.api.search.SearchOperator} unless otherwise noted.  The primary place where this differs
 * is on principal name-based criteria (see below).</p>
 *
 * <p><On criteria which contains a principal name, the rules are as follows:</p>
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>only literal principal names that resolve to a valid principal are allowed</li>
 *   <li>however, if the principal names don't resolve to valid prinicpals, this simply means the lookup will return no results</li>
 *   <li>"!" is allowed before a principal name</li>
 *   <li>when wanting to search for more than one principal, "|" and "&&" is allowed though they cannot be used together</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>Wildcards, ranges, and other "inequality" operators (such as ">", "<", etc.) are not permitted on principal names.</p>
 *
 * <p>In cases where a criteria element takes a list of values, this should be treated as an implicit "OR" by the lookup
 * implementation.  This is true of document attribute values as well, which are passed as a map keyed off the
 * document attribute name with a list of values representing the document attribute values to be searched for.</p>
 *
 * <p>The optional "save name" on the search defines a name under which the criteria can be stored so that it can be
 * recalled and reused later.</p>
