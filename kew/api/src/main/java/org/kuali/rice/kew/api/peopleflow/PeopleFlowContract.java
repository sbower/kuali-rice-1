/**
 * Contract interface for a PeopleFlowDefinition.  A PeopleFlowDefinition is simply a collections of members and their (optional) delegates.
 * Each member of a PeopleFlowDefinition has a priority number assigned to it, which indicates the order in which members should
 * be processed during execution of the flow.
 *
 * <p>Priority is ordered by the lowest priority number being the "beginning" of the flow.  It is possible for one or
 * more members to have the same priority number, in which case they should be processed in parallel.</p>
 *
 * <p>Members of a flow can be one of either a principal, group, or role which is defined by the
 * {@link PeopleFlowMemberContract}.</p>
