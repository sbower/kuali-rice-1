/**
 * An object that determines a list of constraints for a given Constrainable definition for an attribute 
 * in the data dictionary. The ConstraintProvider interface must be implemented by any class that contributes
 * Constraints to the DictionaryValidationService. Multiple ConstraintProviders can be registered simultaneously,
 * and each can contribute constraints for any number of constraint types. 
 * 
 * These constraints can be looked up in a variety of ways. They may be:
 * 
 * (1) member variables of the Constrainable definition itself {@see CaseConstrainable.class}
 * (2) the Constrainable definition itself may extend Constraint {@see LengthConstrainable.class}
 * (3) provided from some external source, or generated on the fly
 * 
 * The goal here is to provide a mechanism that enables implementing institutions to inject new Constraints and ConstraintProcessor
 * classes into the DictionaryValidationService implementation via dependency injection.
