/**
 * Defines methods common to all DataDictionaryDefinition types.
 * 
 *     DD: The highest level objects in the data dictionary are of
        the following types:
        * BusinessObjectEntry
        * MaintenanceDocumentEntry
        * TransactionalDocumentEntry

    JSTL: The data dictionary is exposed as a Map which is accessed
    by referring to the "DataDictionary" global constant.  This Map contains
    the following kinds of entries keyed as indicated:
        * Business Object Entries -
            Key = dataObjectClass name
            Value = Map created by BusinessObjectEntryMapper
        * Maintenance Document entries -
            Key = DocumentType name
            Value = Map created by MaintenanceObjectEntryMapper
        * Transactional Document entries -
            Key = DocumentType name
            Value = Map created by TransactionalDocumentEntryMapper

    All elements are exposed to JSTL as Maps (where the element has a
    unique key by which they can be retrieved), or Strings.  For collections
    of elements having no unique key, the entry's position in the list
    (0, 1, etc.) is used as its index.

    All Maps (except the top-level DataDictionary one) are guaranteed to
    present their entries with an iteration order identical to the order
    in which the elements were defined in XML.
