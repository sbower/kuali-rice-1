/**
 * Layout manager implementations that work with a collection (such as a table
 * layout) should implement this interface for building the collection
 * <code>Component</code> instances
 * 
 * <p>
 * Unlike other <code>Group</code> instances, <code>CollectionGroup</code>
 * instances need to generate new instances of the configured components for
 * each line of the collection. The <code>Field</code> instances for each line
 * are wrapped differently depending on what <code>LayoutManager</code> is being
 * applied. Therefore as the collection lines are being built (during the
 * applyModel phase) this method will be invoked on the manager so that it may
 * setup the line as needed.
