-- KULRICE-2870 - generate names for all existing rules that don't have one
-- if I was better at PL/SQL i could probably figure out a better way to do
-- this, but it will basically set up and generate rule names for rules with
-- up to 1000 different versions, if you have rules with more versions than
-- that, you can update the loop condition
